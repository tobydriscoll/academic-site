abstract: The human tear film is a multilayer structure in which the dynamics are
  often strongly affected by a floating lipid layer. That layer has liquid crystalline
  characteristics and plays important roles in the health of the tear film. Previous
  models have treated the lipid layer as a Newtonian fluid in extensional flow. Motivated
  to develop a more realistic treatment, we present a model for the extensional flow
  of thin sheets of nematic liquid crystal. The rod-like molecules of these substances
  impart an elastic contribution to the rheology. We rescale a weakly elastic model
  due to Cummings et al. [``Extensional flow of nematic liquid crystal with an applied
  electric field,'' Eur. J. Appl. Math. 25, 397â€“ 423 (2014).] to describe a lipid
  layer of moderate elasticity. The resulting system of two nonlinear partial differential
  equations for sheet thickness and axial velocity is fourth order in space, but still
  represents a significant reduction of the full system. We analyze solutions arising
  from several different boundary conditions, motivated by the underlying application,
  with particular focus on dynamics and underlying mechanisms under stretching. We
  solve the system numerically, via collocation with either finite difference or Chebyshev
  spectral discretization in space, together with implicit time stepping. At early
  times, depending on the initial film shape, pressure either aids or opposes extensional
  flow, which changes the free surface dynamics of the sheet and can lead to patterns
  reminiscent of those observed in tear films. We contrast this finding with the cases
  of weak elasticity and Newtonian flow, where the sheet retains the same qualitative
  shape throughout time.
